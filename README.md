# TumbleBit

Proof of Concept implementation of TumbleBit as an untrusted [classic tumbler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_tumbler) as described in: ["TumbleBit: An Untrusted Bitcoin-Compatible Anonymous Payment Hub"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575). 

**Description:** TumbleBit is a new anonymous payments protocol that is fully compatible with todayâ€™s Bitcoin protocol. TumbleBit allows parties to make payments through an untrusted Tumbler. No-one, not even the Tumbler, can tell which payer paid which payee during a TumbleBit epoch. TumbleBit consists of two interleaved fair-exchange protocols that prevent theft of bitcoins by cheating users or a malicious Tumbler. TumbleBit combines fast cryptographic computations (performed off the blockchain) with standard bitcoin scripting functionalities (on the blockchain) that realize smart contracts. TumbleBit was used to mix [800 input addresses](https://blockchain.info/tx/fd51bd844202ef050f1fbe0563e3babd2df3c3694b61af39ac811ad14f52b233) to [800 output addresses](https://blockchain.info/tx/8520da7116a1e634baf415280fdac45f96e680270ea06810512531a783f0c9f6) on Bitcoin's blockchain. 

We will be posting a development roadmap shortly.

### Warning
This code is very early in its development (proof-of-concept phase) and is currently not ready for production.

* Don't use the default keys if you plan on posting transactions on testnet or mainnet.
* We have not audited this code for vulnerabilities and we are actively fixing memory corruption vulnerabilities.
* There are known memory leaks in the networking code of the servers.
* The servers currently do not handle more than one client at a time.
* There are known [side channel attacks on ECDSA in openssl](https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/mobilesc/).

---
### Dependencies

- LibreSSL Version 2.3.4 or higher
- Boost
- ZMQ
- Bitcoind (Optional: for posting transactions)
- Python dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
 + python-bitcoinlib
 + simplejson
 + pyzmq
 + pycrypto

For ubuntu, you can install the dependencies by running:
```
./ubuntu_setup.sh
```
### Building

Default build setting is to have the clients and
the servers on the same machine.

If you want to run the servers on different machines,
change TUMBLER_SERVER_SOCKET and SIGNER_SERVER_SOCKET in
include/constants.h to point to the ip of your machine.

All resulting binaries will be in the _bin_ directory

- Clients & Servers:
 + ```make```
- Servers:
  + ```make tumbler_server```
  + ```make signer_server```
- Clients:
  + ```make bob_client```
  + ```make alice_client_test``` Only runs the puzzle-solver protocol
- Tests: Tests are located in src/test
 + ```make test_name```

### Running

- Full Tumbler run:
  + ```./python/tx_server.py```
  + ```./bin/tumbler_server```
  + ```./bin/signer_server```
  + ```./bin/bob_client```
- Just the Puzzle Solver protocol:
  + ```./python/tx_server.py```
  + ```./bin/signer_server```
  + ```./bin/alice_client_test```
